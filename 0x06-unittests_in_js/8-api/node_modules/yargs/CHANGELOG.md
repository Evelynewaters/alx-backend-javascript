BREAKING CHANGES
extends key in config file is now used for extending other config files

by default options, and many of yargs' parsing helpers will now default to being applied globally; such that they are no-longer reset before being passed into commands.
yargs will no longer aggressively suppress errors, allowing errors that are not generated internally to bubble.
