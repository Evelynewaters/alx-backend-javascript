introduces support for default commands, using the '*' identifier (#785) (d78a0f5)

BREAKING CHANGES
extends key in config file is now used for extending other config files
environment variables now take precedence over config files.

the arguments passed to functions are now validated, there's a good chance this will throw exceptions for a few folks who are using the API in an unexpected way.
by default options, and many of yargs' parsing helpers will now default to being applied globally; such that they are no-longer reset before being passed into commands.
yargs will no longer aggressively suppress errors, allowing errors that are not generated internally to bubble.
